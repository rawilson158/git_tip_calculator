## Restaurant Tip Calculator

This is a simple restaurant tip calculator for patrons to use in an effort to simplify paying a food bill. The calculator will allow an individual to enter random values to arrive at a total food cost when dinning out. Furthermore, this application aids in splitting the bill evenly among the party.

### The tip calculator uses four pieces of key information from a users input which are listed below:

1. Cost of Food
2. Tip Percentage
3. Sales Tax Percentage
4. Number of Patrons

* **(Note)** *The tip and sales tax was calculated seperately on just the cost of food. It is worth mentioning that various customs or group norms may prefer to calculate the tip and sales tax much differently.*
